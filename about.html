                <h1>Values</h1>
                <p1>Kids dream of being scientists, astronauts, and doctors. The one thing these careers have in common: A college degree. My family members did not have the opportunity to go to college, yet they were never bitter or heartbroken over the fact. However, I have watched my dad work as a blue collar painter for years, breaking down his body, and realized that I could be the change in my family by going to college. While I am grateful for my opportunity to go to college, so many people go without it simply because they lack the resources. It is unfair that so many kids go without opportunities like private tutors, personalized classes, and expensive extracurriculars. As someone who was homeschooled K-8, I understand what it’s like to learn in a condition without resources. While  these less fortunate students develop self teaching skills and learn how to motivate themselves to do their work, some gaps form in their education that wouldn’t have if they had the proper resources. This is exactly why I take on tutoring opportunities like Math Club and School House, as well as opportunities to be a mentor in clubs like Future Business Leaders of America, Positive Peer Influences, and SkillsUSA. I want to help people who are less fortunate have the same opportunities as the upper class.</p1>

                <h1>Objectives</h1>
                <p1>I am going to go to college and learn to be a software engineer, hopefully minoring in business to develop my social skills alongside my technical skills. Additionally, I will continue to develop personal projects, like this website, so that I can strengthen my skills as a developer and keep up with current development techniques. While I work towards furthering my career, I would like to start a family as well as develop tools to help students get the resources they need. You may be asking, how are you going to accomplish any of this? Well, being homeschooled developed my learning skills, allowing me to teach myself things without someone there to help me. My self lead learning paired with my self motivation allows me to not only accomplish projects, but also grow as an individual during those projects. I taught myself to build my own computer at the age of 13, I taught myself to build this website, and I will continue to teach myself in conjunction with my formal education, so that I stand out among my peers.</p1>
