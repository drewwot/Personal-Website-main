                <h1>Values</h1>
                <p1>Children often dream of becoming scientists, astronauts, or doctors—careers that typically require a college degree. While my family didn’t have the chance to pursue higher education, they never harbored resentment. However, watching my father work as a blue-collar painter, wearing down his body over the years, inspired me to break that cycle by attending college. Although I’m grateful for this opportunity, many others lack the resources to do the same. It's unjust that so many children miss out on essential resources like private tutors, specialized classes, and extracurriculars. Having been homeschooled K-8, I understand the challenges of learning without access to such support. While students in these circumstances develop self-motivation, gaps in education can form without adequate resources. This fuels my passion for giving back through tutoring with Math Club and School House, and mentoring in organizations such as FBLA, Positive Peer Influences, and SkillsUSA. My goal is to help close the opportunity gap and provide the support that many underserved students deserve.</p1>

                <h1>Objectives</h1>
                <p1>I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering while also continuing to work on personal projects, such as this website, to enhance my development skills and stay up-to-date with industry advancements. As I build my career, I also aspire to start a family and create tools that provide students with better access to educational resources. You may wonder how I intend to achieve these goals. Being homeschooled has equipped me with strong self-directed learning abilities, enabling me to independently acquire new skills. This self-driven approach, combined with my motivation, allows me not only to complete projects but also to grow personally through them. At 13, I taught myself to build a computer, followed by developing this website, and I will continue to leverage both self-learning and formal education to set myself apart in the field.</p1>
